# World-Energy-Consumption-Analysis
An exploratory analysis of energy consumption of 242 countries between the year 1900 - 2020.

Did you know?

That fossil fuel is the most consumed energy sources, highest electricity production sources and highest energy per capita in the world.

That oil has come to be the second most used form of energy in the world in as much as it's one of the least form of electricity production?

That Gilbratar is by far the highest country by energy per capita?
And in Energy per GDP, Trindad and Tobago came first

Take a proper look on my analysis on #worldenergyconsumption1900-2020 I analysed using #tableau and you'll find the various insights regarding the various energy resources in the likes of coal, gas, low carbon, Renewables, Hydro, Nuclear, other renewables and more.
